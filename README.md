This is my project submitted for The Great Mind Challenge 2012, an all-India software development contest held by IBM.

The main aim of this project is to simplify the process of managing student and faculty responsibilites in a university. Titled "Universal Student Identification using RFID", the project primarily focuses on marking attendance of students using an RFID system. Other modules include: Faculty Salary Issue, Internal Marks Calculation, and Performance Report Generation.

Also automatic emails would be sent to the parents, students and faculty of the department regarding the monthly performance reports. Also, automatic texts would be sent out students, parents or faculty about important events in the university.

For a short video of the project, please see the Video_Demo file in the Documentation folder.

This project was ranked in the top 30 out of 100,000 entries for the contest.
